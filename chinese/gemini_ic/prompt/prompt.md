Create a JSON for the Lesson 5 Dialogue 1 vocabulary using both of the attached pdf's. It should be a list of objects with the following properties: "english" (the definition), "pinyin" (the pinyin with tones e.g. h«éo; it should always be lowercase), "characters" (the simplified Chinese characters), and "lesson" (the lesson the item is from, as a number). If the following items occur, condense them into a single item: 1) numbers (include numbers 0-10 and 100 in a single flashcard), 2) days of the week, 3) months. If items overlap between the PDFs, favor the Integrated Chinese vocabulary, not the slide deck. If a word is a "sub-word" of an actual phrase, only include the phrase (do not also include its components).
